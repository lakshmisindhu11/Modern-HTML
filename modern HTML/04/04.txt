3 ways to improve accessibility in HTML
Use semantic HTML
Semantic HTML elements help screen readers interpret a page's structure, which allows users to navigate and understand the content more easily. 
 
Use descriptive link text
Descriptive link text helps users understand what they'll find when they click on a link. 
 
Use proper color contrast
Proper color contrast helps users read content, especially those with visual disabilities like color blindness.
