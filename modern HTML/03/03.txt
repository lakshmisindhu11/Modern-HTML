Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.
 We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice 
 of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, 
 or those with slow network connections.

 benefits:
 -  Accessibility is a key factor in search engine optimization (SEO) as search engines favor websites that 
 are accessible to all users.
 -  Accessibility is a key factor in user experience (UX) as it ensures that all users can
 navigate and interact with your website.
 -  Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by 
 other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone
  can benefit from many such improvements.
